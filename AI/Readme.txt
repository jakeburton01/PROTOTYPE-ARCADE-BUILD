######Current implementation requires a box collider, OnTrigger, to be attached to Left Hand Attack Point/Right Arm Attack Point/Strong Arm Attack Point#####


Working on player/AI intergration, small amounts of non-AI code will be changed (Will log each change). 
only left punch implemented 

FX on hit is working now, easy AI should be fully implemented now

Changes made in Healthblocks:

Added a public bool AIRegen, initialised in start as false, made true in the regen function.  Simply handles the hp regen for the AI health number as AIs handle HP internally rather than via Healthblocks script


Changes made in AttackUniversal:

Three new public objects to hold scripts when hitting
Ontrigger enter function holding the collission effects


Known Issues:
AI and player can walk through eachother
animations seem very fast
AI can get stuck inside player when it goes for a hit but is within runaway hp threshold. (if under 20 hp it can break into a hit command if its too close and then not break out)
Model doesn't get destroyed when dropped to 0hp (should be easy fix)
Navmesh floats above the arena floor due to bottom of navmesh not being bottom of model


Will provide either a full project file or prefabs when complete









Director AI must be attached to "GameManager" game object in the scene. This attempts to watch the state of each fighter and find a high threat/priority target for the AI to attack. Currently half implemented for finding players.


###Current powerup pathfinding requires objects to be tagged with "Powerup", the spawning script spawns them with different tags vs just using different object names###
AI now properly search for and destroy powerups that are tagged as powerup. (When instantiating a powerup it automatically is named with (clone) affixed, need to in code specify names)





EasyAI Prefab (currently named AI) -
Transform
Animator
Capsule collider (Deactivated)
Character animation   Script   (one active one non active)
Player attack FINAL (Should be deactive)
Navmesh Agent (Speed and distances will be tweaked as gameplay dictates)
Rigidbody    (Set to default values)
Easy AI Script     (Health - 120, Wander radius 10, Wander Timer 5, AI number 1-4, Waypoint prefab will need to be set from waypoint prefab)      (Includes a callable initialization script, but not implemented for startup, needs to be called via change scene script)
HealthBlocks Script (Element0 = HealthBar   Element1 = Healthbar1 etc)

Hit has 20% chance to hit, 80% chance to miss (animation will play for both)


Medium AI same as above:
Behaviours added: Search for random enemy/different attacks (left hand + Strong hit, Although strong damage needs to be checked on implementation)
Search and hit type is decided by random number.

0-2 are hits 3-5 misses    50% chance to hit    50% chance to miss    Can be changed

Working on powerup searching, likely will be priority based.



Current Script only uses basic punch as don't want to mess around with extra animations and collision hitboxes before we have our final/close to final models, for sake of not spending time bugfixing something that wont be used.
Higher difficulty AI will use different search methods (Random, LowestHP, Closest) which are already coded. 
AI priority for any in game drops needs to be coded in still. 
Player should be able to hit the AI     /     AI should be able to hit the Player.


WayPoint Prefab
Transform
Cube MeshFilter
MeshRenderer
BoxCollider (IsTrigger)
WayPointer Script


Canvas Prefab is included but setup of that will vary
